### Midnight Barista

A [Unity]() 2d game that I'm recreating from the description linked js13k game jam game in order to help me make heads and/or tails of this Component-Entity system that Unity employs...and gee, it's sure different from web development!


### Installation

um...I guess clone it and then open it in unity? I'm using version `2018.3.8.f1`.

Dunno if that helps, but there ya go.
